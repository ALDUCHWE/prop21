# ALDUCHWE - Prop 21: Predicting Homeless Population Based on Rent Control
Training sklearn models to build 2 models (1 for a rent controlled city, 1 for for a city without rent control) with features -- median income, unemployment rate, crime numbers, and population count -- to predict homeless population of cities with similar policies. 

##
1. Datasets of each feature for the 4 featured cities are collected within the "data" branch. All other files, including modeling and visualization code, are found in the master branch.

##
2. Abbreviations used within datasets
	```
	SF- San Francisco
	SD- San Diego
	SJ - San Jose
	POP - (city's) population
	UNEMP - (city's) unemployment
##
3. 

Population measured in counts of people based on the U.S. Census Bureau. Unemployment rate of cities were chosen based on the unemployment percentage of cities on the 1st day of the first month for each year recorded. Crime numbers were measured as a crime recording made by city/police reports. There are discrepancies between whether the sources recorded number of actual crimes or the number of crimes simply reported. Median income is added as an average of median incomes for cities annually in U.S. dollars. 

4. JupyterNotebook("datascienceprop21.py") can be ran on an external server for visualization of the model results and training code. Datasets can be downloaded as EXCEL files.
