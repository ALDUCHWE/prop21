# ALDUCHWE - Prop 21: Predicting Homeless Population Based on Rent Control
Training sklearn models to build 2 models (1 for a rent controlled city, 1 for for a city without rent control) with features -- median income, unemployment rate, crime numbers, and population count -- to predict homeless population of cities with similar policies. 

##
1. Datasets of each feature for the 4 featured cities are collected within the "data" branch. All other files, including modeling and visualization code, are found in the master branch.

##
2. Naming conventions
		Naming convention recommendations:	
			YYYYMMDD
			Keywords: location, variables, conditions
			Between 25 and 60 characters
			Beware of capitals, special characters and spaces
			Use underscores between components

##
3. Relationship between files

4. Abbreviations used within datasets
	```

	POP - (city's) population
